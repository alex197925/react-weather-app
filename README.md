## React Weather App

Build a React JS weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. We will be using axios to connect with our API. There are probably a million ways to build a weather app and this is on a more basic level, but a great way to learn a few core fundamentals in React. 


1. Install axios
```typescript
npm i axios
```
2. Import axios
```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
```
